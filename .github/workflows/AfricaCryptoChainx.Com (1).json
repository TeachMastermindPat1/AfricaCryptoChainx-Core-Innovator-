        "pattern": " ```regex \\bmy project information\\b ```  ### Explanation of the Regex Pattern: - `\\b`: Word boundary ensures that \"my project information\" is matched as a whole word. - `my project information`: This literal text specifies the exact phrase you're looking for. - `\\b`: Another word boundary ensures the phrase is matched completely.  ### Usage Examples:  #### Using `grep` in Unix/Linux:  To search for lines containing \"my project information\":  ```bash grep -E \"\\bmy project information\\b\" <file_name> ```  Replace `<file_name>` with the actual file you want to search in.  #### In Python:  ```python import re  text = \"\"\"Your project information can be found in the documentation. For my project information is crucial for our stakeholders. \"\"\"  pattern = r'\\bmy project information\\b' matches = re.findall(pattern, text)  for match in matches:     print(match) ```  This Python script will print occurrences of \"my project information\" as a whole word in the `text`.  ### Notes: - Adjust the regex pattern (`\\bmy project information\\b`) as needed based on specific requirements or variations in your text. - Regular expressions offer flexibility but may require careful testing and adjustment to match exactly what you intend. - The `\\b` word boundary ensures that you're matching the exact phrase and not parts of other words that contain similar sequences.",

        "name": "   ### Description of `\\bmy project information\\b` Regex Pattern  The regex pattern `\\bmy project information\\b` is designed to match the exact phrase \"my project information\" as a whole word within a text or data source. Here's a breakdown of its components and usage:  - **`\\b`**: The `\\b` metacharacter denotes a word boundary, ensuring that \"my project information\" is matched as a complete word and not as part of a longer word or phrase.  - **`my project information`**: This is the literal text string that the pattern seeks to match precisely. It must appear exactly as specified, including capitalization and spacing.  - **`\\b`**: Another `\\b` ensures that the pattern matches \"my project information\" as a standalone word, ensuring accuracy and avoiding partial matches.  ### Purpose and Usage:  - **Purpose**: This pattern is useful for identifying instances where the specific phrase \"my project information\" occurs within a document or dataset. It ensures that only exact matches are captured, enhancing search precision.  - **Usage**:    - **Command-Line Tools**: Use this pattern with tools like `grep` on Unix/Linux systems to search for lines containing \"my project information\" in files.     ```bash     grep -E \"\\bmy project information\\b\" <file_name>     ```   - **Programming Languages**: Implement this pattern in programming languages such as Python using the `re` module to find occurrences within strings or data structures.     ```python     import re          text = \"For my project information, please refer to the documentation.\"     pattern = r'\\bmy project information\\b'     matches = re.findall(pattern, text)     print(matches)  # Output: ['my project information']     ```  ### Considerations:  - **Adjustments**: Modify the pattern as needed for case sensitivity (`\\bMy Project Information\\b`), plural forms (`\\bmy project informations?\\b`), or variations in text structure.  - **Regex Flexibility**: While powerful, regex patterns require testing and adjustment to match specific variations in text content accurately.  ### Conclusion:  The `\\bmy project information\\b` regex pattern ensures precise matching of the exact phrase \"my project information\" as a standalone word, facilitating accurate identification and retrieval within textual data."
