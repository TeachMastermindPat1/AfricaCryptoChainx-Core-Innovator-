git clone <repository-url>

# Check the status of your files
git status

# Add changes to the staging area
git add <file-name>  # or use '.' to add all changes

# Commit your changes with a relevant message
git commit -m "Updated README.md with project details for AfricaCryptoChainx"

# Push changes to a remote repository
git push origin main
```

### b. Using Jupyter Notebook for Documentation and Analysis

Jupyter Notebook is a free tool that allows you to document your project and perform data analysis interactively.

#### Installation

## 2. Free Bot for User Engagement

### a. Creating a Telegram Bot for AfricaCryptoChainx

Building a Telegram bot can enhance user engagement and provide support to your community.

#### Installation

```bash
pip install python-telegram-bot
```

#### Basic Bot Code

Here's a simple example of a Telegram bot for AfricaCryptoChainx that welcomes users and provides information about the project.

```python
import logging
from telegram import Update
from telegram.ext import Updater, CommandHandler, CallbackContext

# Enable logging
logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)

# Define a command handler
def start(update: Update, context: CallbackContext) -> None:
    welcome_message = (
        "Welcome to AfricaCryptoChainx Bot!\n"
        "We empower Africa with blockchain technology.\n"
        "Explore our features:\n"
        "- Robust fiat deposit options\n"
        "- Seamless sending and receiving capabilities\n"
        "For more information, visit our website!"
    )
    update.message.reply_text(welcome_message)

def main() -> None:
    # Replace 'YOUR_TOKEN' with your actual bot token
    updater = Updater("YOUR_TOKEN")

    # Get the dispatcher to register handlers
    dispatcher = updater.dispatcher

    # Register the start command handler
    dispatcher.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start))

    # Start the Bot
    updater.start_polling()

    # Run the bot until you send a signal to stop
    updater.idle()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### b. Explanation
